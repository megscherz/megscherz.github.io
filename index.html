				<!-- How I Work & Test Plan -->
				<section class="spotlight style1 orient-right content-align-left image-position-center onscroll-image-fade-in" id="how-i-work">
					<div class="content">
					  <h2>How I Work</h2>
					  <p>I believe quality assurance isn't just about catching bugs—it's about building confidence in software. I aim to catch potential failures early by designing scalable, maintainable test automation frameworks and collaborating closely with developers and stakeholders. My approach is proactive and detail-oriented, with an emphasis on testability and early feedback loops.</p>
					  <p>I'm comfortable owning test pipelines in CI/CD environments and troubleshooting flaky tests to restore pipeline health quickly. I see QA as a partner in delivering better user experiences—not a gatekeeper, but a guide toward cleaner, more reliable code.</p>
				  
					  <hr />
				  
					  <h3>Sample Test Plan</h3>
						<p>Even though I can't share client code, I've created a fictional sample test plan to demonstrate how I think through test strategy, edge cases, and pipeline design. This includes:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>A sample feature test case</li>
							<li>A simplified automation architecture diagram</li>
							<li>A test strategy document for a mock product</li>
						</ul>

				<!-- Previous Careers -->
				<section class="spotlight style1 orient-left content-align-right image-position-center onscroll-image-fade-in" id="previous-careers">
					<div class="content">
						<h2>Previous Careers</h2>
							<p>Before transitioning into software development and quality engineering, I built a strong foundation in two people-focused careers.</p>
							<br />
							<p>I began as an elementary school teacher after earning my degree from Northern Illinois University, teaching 2nd and 3rd grades and spending a year as an ESL specialist. That experience sharpened my communication, organization, and problem-solving skills—core strengths I bring to every role. Later, I followed my passion for fitness and became a certified personal trainer, working at F45 and at a gym with private clients. I've trained individuals on goals ranging from weight loss to mobility and found deep fulfillment in helping others reach their potential. Both of these roles strengthened my empathy, patience, and adaptability—qualities I now apply in collaborative software environments.</p>

					<h2>Past projects - Actualize capstone project</h2>
						<p>The culmination of my skills learned at Actualize Coding Bootcamp: <b>Alternatively Green.</b> This web application helps users find eco-friendly versions of their favorite standard, household products. The applications leverages a <b>Ruby on Rails</b> backend framework, <b>PostgresQL</b> database with several models and a self-referencing join table, and a <b>VueJS</b>-based frontend. Below you will see a presentation of the work in progress. I'm excited to continue developing this project and intend to see it through to a live launch.</p>
