						<h2>Introduction</h2>
						<p>👋 Hi, I'm Meghan — a software engineer with a strong focus on test automation and quality assurance. I've worked on legal tech, healthcare, and HR platforms, building robust test automation suites with Playwright, XUnit, and Katalon Studio. I specialize in making software reliable, maintainable, and user-friendly. My career history includes experience in diverse fields: <b>Software Engineering, Elementary Education</b>, and <b>Health and Fitness</b>. Outside of work you will find me playing with my 1 year old son, lifting weights at the gym, reading, or spending time online shopping for things I probably don't need.</p>

					<div class="content">
						<h2>Previous careers: Educator & personal trainer</h2>
							<p>Before transitioning into software development and quality engineering, I built a strong foundation in two people-focused careers. I began as an elementary school teacher after earning my degree from Northern Illinois University, teaching 2nd and 3rd grades and spending a year as an ESL specialist. That experience sharpened my communication, organization, and problem-solving skills—core strengths I bring to every role.<br/>
							Later, I followed my passion for fitness and became a certified personal trainer, working at F45 and with private clients. I've trained individuals on goals ranging from weight loss to mobility and found deep fulfillment in helping others reach their potential. Both of these roles strengthened my empathy, patience, and adaptability—qualities I now apply in collaborative software environments.</p>

					<h2>Past projects - Actualize capstone project</h2>
						<p>The culmination of my skills learned at Actualize Coding Bootcamp: <b>Alternatively Green.</b> This web application helps users find eco-friendly versions of their favorite standard, household products. The applications leverages a <b>Ruby on Rails</b> backend framework, <b>PostgresQL</b> database with several models and a self-referencing join table, and a <b>VueJS</b>-based frontend. Below you will see a presentation of the work in progress. I'm excited to continue developing this project and intend to see it through to a live launch.</p>
